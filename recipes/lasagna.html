    <h3>Chicken lasagna with spinach and a creamy white cheese sauce.</h3>
    
    <p>Great for any kind of potluck. My kids love it!</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>Noodles</li>
        <li>Ricotta Mixture</li>
        <li>Mozzarella Slices</li>
        <li>Meat Sauce</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 400ºF. Arrange a rack in the middle of the
             oven and heat the oven to 400°F.</li>
        <li> Finely chop 1 medium yellow onion. 
            Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 12-inch or
             larger regular or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onion, 
             1 pound lean ground beef, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, and cook, breaking the beef up into 
             small pieces with a wooden spoon, until the beef is cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes.
            Remove from the heat and let cool for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare the baking dish and assemble the meat sauce. 
            Open 1 (24 to 25-ounce) jar marinara sauce (3 cups). Spread a thin layer of the sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Stir 
            the remaining sauce into the ground beef mixture.</li>
        <li>Begin layering the lasagna. Shred 12 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese 
            if needed (3 cups). Place 5 lasagna noodles in the baking dish, breaking them if needed to create a single layer 
            (it’s OK if the noodles overlap slightly). Dollop and spread 1 cup of the ricotta cheese over the noodles. Dollop 
            and spread about 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce on the ricotta, 
            then sprinkle with 1 cup of the mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Continue layering the lasagna. Arrange 5 more 
            noodles over the mozzarella, followed by 1 cup 
            of the ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 cups of the meat
            sauce, and 1 cup of the mozzarella. Top with a 
            final layer of 5 noodles and the remaining sauce, spreading the sauce thin so that it almost completely covers the noodles. (Reserve the remaining 1 cup mozzarella for the end of baking.) 
            Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil</li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna for 1 hour. Bake for 1 hour.
            Check to make sure the noodles are done by 
            poking the lasagna with a knife; the knife 
            should slide easily through all the layers. 
            If it doesn't, cover and cook for 15 minutes 
            more.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella and 
            finish baking. Uncover the lasagna and sprinkle 
            with the remaining 1 cup mozzarella. Bake uncovered 
            until the mozzarella is melted and lightly browned, 
            and the sauce is bubbling, 8 to 10 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Cool the lasagna for 15 minutes. Let the lasagna
            cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes 
            before serving.</li>
    </ol>
